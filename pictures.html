                <b>Yoruichi Shihōin</b> is a slender and well-endowed woman of
                average height. She has dark skin, golden irises, and black
                hair. Her hair is waist-length and kept in a ponytail with
                chin-length bangs framing the sides of her face. Her standard
                attire consists of a black, backless, sleeveless undershirt, an
                orange over-shirt with two white straps on each shoulder, a
                large beige sash around her waist, and black stretch pants with
                a pair of lightweight brown shoes, which allow for stealth and
                easy use of <em>Shunpo</em>. She previously wore a beige neck
                warmer, which she pulled up to cover her face in order to hide
                her identity, but seems to have forgone its use. She
                occasionally wears long beige wrist and leg warmers, each
                secured by bands. During the Quincy Blood War, Yoruichi wears a
                short dress, arm warmers and thigh length boots.

                <b>Feline Transformation</b>: Yoruichi possesses the unique
                ability to shape-shift into a black cat at will. How she alone,
                out of all Shinigami, is capable of this is currently unknown.
                She has possessed the ability for well over 100 years, and it is
                known to others she knew from that time<br />
                Shunpo Master: Considered to be the most proficient
                <i>Hohō master</i>
                ever in all of Soul Society, Yoruichi is immensely skilled in
                the use of Shunpo. Yoruichi holds the title "Flash Goddess"
                (瞬神, Shunshin; Viz "Flash Master"), because she has mastered
                this ability to the point where she can appear to be in several
                places at once and wipe out an entire Onmitsukidō squadron in
                seconds. She can easily close tremendous gaps of distance in the
                blink of an eye while remaining undetected, and can surprise
                Byakuya, who is one of the most proficient masters in the art as
                well

              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Yoruichi</b> is intelligent and witty, holding an intimate
                knowledge of Soul Society and its workings, as she was the
                former leader of the Onmitsukidō and the Second Division's
                captain. Although of noble birth, she acts differently from most
                other nobles, very much like <em>Kaien Shiba</em>. For instance,
                she instructed <em>Suì-Fēng</em> to refer to her without using
                honorific suffixes, but reluctantly settled for being called
                "Yoruichi-sama". On several occasions, she transforms into her
                Human form directly in front of Ichigo just to see his reaction
                to seeing her naked, which she teases him about. In addition,
                she speaks in a dialect used by elders, such as identifying
                herself as "washi" (a term usually used by old men to define
                themselves with), instead of more feminine terms like "watashi",
                in both her Human and animal forms.
